# PIES
## Port Internet Exploit Scanner

This tool is a simple port scanner written in Python. It is in just 50 lines of code, and works without bugs (that I know of).

### How to use:

1. CD to the directory where the script was installed.
2. Run `python pies.py min max host` in the command line with min and max being the port range, host being the host you want to scan.
4. Watch the show!
